    # abstract:

    # Plain language summary.
    # Similar to an abstract, but can either be slightly longer and more detailed or used as
    # a plain-language summary, depending on the context.

    # results, and conclusions.
    # Alias: `plain_language_summary`, `lay_summary`

    # It's crucial for transparency and reproducibility in research documents.
    # Alias: `availability`
    # data_availability:
    # A section where the author thanks individuals, organizations, or agencies that contributed
